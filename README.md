## FAQs

### How do I read the table?

The table is alphabetised by school name.

Economics Master's + PhD funded programmes are predominantly shown (US programmes
are virtually all Master's + PhD structured).

If a programme is PhD only (i.e., requires holding a Master's degree for admission),
I will explicitly state as such, in parentheses, under the school name.

Programmes with no information stated can be assumed to provide a Master's + PhD
structure (regardless of location). At the moment, I am following this structure
for US programmes. To be better safe than sorry, I am specifying Master's + PhD
structure for non-US programmes. The specific type(s) of master's degree (e.g., MPhil)
will be provided if mentioned by the programme.

Application deadlines listed are chosen because the corresponding programmes
consider them to be the latest possible date eligible for PhD funding. **If there
are multiply deadlines because of multiply intake dates, the table defaults by
listing the deadline closest to the US-equivalent start date of fall semester.
Always double-check by using the provided programme URL**!S

**I recommend looking into the programme website in order to confirm if the PhD
starts in the fall or spring semester since this information is not included in
the table for conciseness sake**.

I **WILL NOT** show unfunded PhD deadlines because I believe they are massive
opportunity costs that are worth neither the time nor the effort. **Don't waste
your life doing these programmes**.

### Who are you?

I'm an economics PhD candidate at [UT Austin](https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/economics/gradstudents/plt377)
on the [2025&ndash;26 job market](https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/economics/ph-d-program/job-market-candidates.html).
My fields of interest are macroeconomics and monetary economics. I use text
analysis and natural language processing to study how policy communication
impacts economic outcomes and expectations. I'm also a USAPL powerlifter
(519kg total club). If you want to find out more about me and my research,
please visit my [personal website](https://paulletran.com). You can also find my
research on [my Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0zKxrWgAAAAJ),
[my SSRN profile](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/cf_dev/AbsByAuth.cfm?per_id=7065188),
[my GitHub profile](https://github.com/paultran47), and my ORCID (0009-0000-8559-7915).

### Why did you make this website?

Because most schools' PhD websites are bloody awful at clearly displaying the
application deadlines. Often times, a prospective student has to search and click
through a bunch of pages before they can find the application deadline.

Additionally, no single website existed that hosted all deadline information for
free. As a result, I made this GitHub Page to track and display this information
front and centre for myself at the time and for all future applicants.

### Are you going to be adding more schools?

Slowly. While this is a personal project, I have full intention of making this
website contains the deadlines of hundreds of PhD programmes eventually.

You can check the <a href="#changelog">changelog</a> on the GitHub repo page.

If you don't see a particular economics PhD programme, please
[submit an issue to the GitHub repo](https://github.com/paultran47/econ-grad-app-deadlines/issues)
with the school's PhD programme website URL, country, and application deadline.

### Will you be adding Master's only programmes?

Maybe. However, the priority will always be Master's + PhD or PhD only programmes.

### How is the information updated?

Manually, because I haven't bothered to make it more automated by scrapping each
school's PhD websites.

### Why isn't the year included?

The day and month are the most important parts of the deadline. If one needs to
know the year for absolute certainty (e.g., January deadlines), the programme
website is provided.
